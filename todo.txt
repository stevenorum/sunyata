-When updates get made, new deployments aren't created.  We need to handle this somehow, so that updates can get deployed without fully recreating the stack.
--Handled by removing and then re-adding the deployment resource to the template.

-Look into http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html to improve how stuff gets passed to the backing lambda functions.  Important part is to make sure that the return value gets interpreted as the correct content-type.
--Can now pass as direct proxy.

-Figure out how to also support other restful methods, not just get, while still keeping things simple.
